# Guns and Goblins
## A 2D Shoot-Em-Up in a Dungeon Setting
_Guns and Goblins_ is a small, WIP game made using Unity and C#. 
It features animations, some custom artwork, gun mechanics, bosses, NPCs, and at least one level.

My goal is to create a single, fun and exciting level that will explore many different game mechanics, including: fights with enemies and bosses, interactions with NPCs, puzzles, inventory and items, and hopefully much more.

Code can be found within `Assets/Scripts`. The logic divided into component classes, for use with the Unity Component system. Artwork and Code are free to use, commercially or otherwise. Though, some of the artwork – namely the "Atlas" file – is not mine, and was sourced from [0x72's website](https://0x72.itch.io/16x16-dungeon-tileset?download).
